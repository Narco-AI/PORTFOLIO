        I am an Experience Designer whose primary interests are in the
        areas of animation, branding + poster design with a strategic
        and an animated focus.
        
        My goal is to automate design and technology.
        I tend to look for inspiration from observation,
        conversation, and formal design research to stretch my perspective.
        
        I originally started with basic editing and programming in my 
        high school like using java, SQL, after effects, illustrator. No matter what
        I'm working on, I try to think of how what I'm helping to create fits
        into a larger system, and continue to question what benefit it has for
        the user.
        
        I want to be able to branch out as an experience designer, allowing
        myself to learn new and more meaningful ways to solve problems,
        and new skills that help me turn my ideas into reality, and magical
        experiences.
        
        I hope you liked what you see here and would love to chat more
        about my ongoing work and thinking!
