        I am an Experience Designer whose primary interests are in the
        areas of animation, branding + poster design with a strategic
        and an animated focus.
        
        My goal is to automate design and technology.
        I tend to look for inspiration from observation,
        conversation, and formal design research to stretch my perspective.
        
        I originally started with basic editing and programming in my 
        high school, using Java, SQL, After Effects, Illustrator. No matter what
        I'm working on, I try to think of how, what I'm helping to create fits
        into a larger system, and continue to question what benefit it yields for
        the user.
        
        I want to branch out as someone whose progress could make a difference for 
        them, allowing myself to learn new and more meaningful ways to solve problems,
        and new skills that help me turn my ideas into reality, and magical
        experiences.
        
        I hope you like what you see here and criticism, not just constructive,
        is ever welcome:)
